                                        This program means so much to me. Having transferred to MSU last year and actually experiencing another college team, I can assure people that this team is like no other. This is the most close-knit, supporting team I have ever been on. Everyone is so close with one another, we truly are a family. With this program being cut, I feel like I lost a family member. I feel like a family member was taken from me so suddenly and I can not describe the pain. This program means everything to us swimmers.

                                        I choose MSU for multiple reasons. To begin, I loved the closeness of the team, which is honestly hard to find. I loved the coaches coach ethic and their personalities on deck. It really drove me to want to be a better swimmer and become a better person. These experiences from MSU have turned me into a better person, which I will always be grateful for. Regardless of what anyone says, I really love the pool. It is a pool that has so many memories for the current members of the team and many alumni. It doesn’t matter what a pool looks like, it matters what happens in that pool.

                                        The biggest life lesson I learned from MSU is the true meaning of family. I will forever remember my teammates and stay in touch with them. I have been at a school that had all the “shiny bells and whistles”; however, at the end of the day that is not what matters. What matters is the people you are spending these times with, a team that shows you the true family dynamic is a team worth spending time with.

                                        This program has changed me for the better. My time as an MSU diver has helped me to grow as a person and improve my diving more than I ever thought possible in three years. I would not be who I am today without MSU Swim and Dive, and it is so heartbreaking that future generations of swimmers and divers will not get to experience this program that I love so much and has had such a positive impact on my life.

                                        I chose MSU for many reasons. I knew I would be majoring in secondary education and it offered one of the best education programs in the country. I also was in contact with diving coach Eric Best throughout my entire high school diving career and I knew that he was a great coach and that we would work well together. I also loved that I would be able to focus on springboard diving (1m and 3m). Finally, my sister was on the MSU gymnastics team, and I could not pass up the opportunity to compete at the same Big Ten school with my sister. I knew from taking to her that being an MSU athlete was an amazing experience.

                                        To me it is the best overall big swimming college program in our wonderful water-loving state of Michigan. It developed me and so many young student-athletes to become the best they can be in and out of the pool. I was fortunate to swim at MSU in the 1980’s. Through the program I grew as a student-athlete tremendously in ability and courage and work ethic. I tore my ACL as a freshman but through the support and love of this team I learned to persevere and achieve through this and other challenges. I have many swimmer friends who swam at other big schools but none had the wonderful bond that this program gives to those lucky enough to swim and dive at MSU.

It was also a chance for me to swim again with my sister Sally. What a wonderfully strong and balanced program for the many swimming families in our state.

                                        In short, everything. This program is honestly the only reason I attended MSU....I grew up as a UM fan, but after meeting my teammates on the recruiting trip, seeing the campus, I fell in love. And I am blessed, because that decision set in motion a huge number of events in my life and shaped who I am as a person, as a leader, and as a father.

                                        MSU felt like home almost immediately during my recruiting trip. I took all 5 official visits to schools like UM, PSU, Northwestern, UNC and MSU and tons of unofficial visits. The only school that felt like home was MSU. It had the worst facilities of all the schools I looked at, but it had the best teammates that truly supported each other, even back then, like brothers and sisters.

The opportunities at MSU are endless and I felt they would best prepare me for life post graduation. Furthermore, throughout the recruiting process I met numerous swimming and diving teams. Michigan State was, by far, the most tight-knit and supportive team I met. I knew that it was a special place with a special team and I feel so grateful to be a part of it.

                                        The MSU swim and dive program the importance in being successful with what you are given. Your internal drive and the internal drive of those around you means and is much stronger than external assistance or perks. At MSU we hustled, got to work, and were successful even without some of the bells and whistles other programs have. This was a blessing in disguise. It taught me how to be resilient in life and made our successes so much more satisfying and 100% ours. In addition to the core values it taught me, it also gave me a home away from home and a connection to my school that I would not have had without swimming or my team. Having looked at other schools to swim at before deciding on MSU and hearing from other friends about their collegiate swimming career, further solidifies my pride in being an MSU swimmer. We were able to pursue our dreams at a B1G University while not making any academic sacrifices, there are very few if any programs that I have encountered that offer those two together. Being apart of a team that practiced such excellence, in and out of the pool, pushed me to become a better version of myself. I would not have the career or self awareness that I have now without MSU swim and dive and the people and experiences I encountered along the way. I love this program, and my love for MSU is not the same given the decision to remove support for this program.

                                        As I said above, I chose MSU because I KNEW with great confidence that I could experience a B1G school, compete SUCCESSFULLY at a B1G level, all the while pursuing an Engineering degree. At MANY schools, most sports programs give you a list of degrees that their athletes are discouraged from pursuing because it would take away from their training. I did not have to make that choice, nor did I ever feel that my swimming career or my academic performance suffered as a result of my commitment to the other. The team and the coaches do not expect anything less even though we are obviously given less. And while this might deter some athletes, I knew it would attract the ones that truly loved this sport while striving for academic excellence. The support I felt the team had for one another was contagious and stronger than I had ever experienced, making it impossible to want to go anywhere else. Even after I committed and trained at MSU, I was fortunate to feel the same because Coach G didn't put on a "special show" or give us empty promises to get us to come to MSU. What we saw was only a fraction of what we got, versus the opposite that most programs do. Which again, attracted only TRUE MSU SPARTANS. The ones who wanted to be there were the ones that showed up regardless which made the experience of being a Spartan so much more organic, authentic, and rewarding.

                                        You will not get any better focusing on what others have or what others are doing "better." Staying in your lane and hustling is the best, and only, thing you have control of. And when you have a community of individuals that practice the same mentality, there is nothing holding them back. Additionally, never take what experience you have for granted. View challenges as happening FOR you not TO you. When I was a freshman, I broke my ankle 2 weeks before B1Gs. I swam, thinking it was only a sprain, to find out I competed at by first B1Gs on a spiral fracture that should have been surgically corrected. This taught me that my career could change in a split second so I worked to take every chance I had to "show up." It also showed me that when those things happen, you have to view it as a chance to get better, tougher, and grow. I would not have been able to do that, or come out on the other side, making finals at B1Gs my junior and senior year and setting school records, if I didn't have my team or coaches placing so much value in the heart and hustle.

                                        This program has given me friendships that will go beyond my college years. I truly consider this swim team my second family; a team that is made up of the most amazing people I have ever met. Being from South Florida, it is difficult to visit home or see my family and relatives, but my class and their parents have all welcomed me into their homes when I wasn’t able to travel.

                                        My college decision process was one of the most stressful times in my life. I knew that I wanted to go somewhere that offered a successful path to my career goal, but still be able to swim at a division 1 level. Michigan State was the ideal place to strive both in and out of the pool. I chose to swim at MSU because of the emphasis of academics. This program’s history of swimmers that go on to become prosperous in their chosen careers was something that really caught my eye. The absence of an 8 lane pool was not something that I even considered as of importance in my college decision. True athletes don’t need luxury; they strive from making the most of what they’re given, and when their goals are reached it is that much more meaningful because of the hard work that was put forth.

                                        <p className="sponsor__text">
                                        The biggest life lesson that I have learned during my time here at MSU is to never take anything for granted. Recently, I have been reminiscing of the times pre-covid. This time last year Michigan State’s Swim and Dive team was competing in dual meets across the country and getting ready to travel to Delray Beach, Florida for a training trip. Group activities among the swim team and other sports teams at MSU were occurring and friendships were being formed left and right. Now, there are currently no dual meets and our training trip (the highlight of the season) is no longer happening. There are restrictions amongst all of the MSU sports teams on campus and it is difficult to even bond with the younger athletes on the swim team. Although I know that it is impossible to control the reality and consequences of a pandemic, these traditions of being on the swim team go back years and would soon be a reality again in the near future. It is so difficult to grasp that those memories may not have any more to build from, if and when there is no longer a swim program next year. My 4 years of swimming in college were cut short and taken from me, after so much hard work and dedication was given over the 15 years as a competitive swimmer. I understand that we should always live life to the fullest, but I now take that more seriously than ever.

My best memories are in that outdoor pool, working hard with my team. I was given so many amazing opportunities, in and out of the pool- something I will always be grateful for. This program is all about building yourself and your relationships- I made lifelong friends and I met my husband through this program. I never want to see this program go away because it means more to me than anyone could know.

                                        I had always dreamed of swimming at a big school. Being from Kentucky, I thought SEC would be where I ended up. After my visit to MSU, my life was changed forever. There was something about that chilly Saturday morning in East Lansing, watching the team swim in the outdoor pool and hearing the band play loud and proud that hit me hard. It felt like a family, one that I instantly wanted to be a part of. I knew the facilities were not as nice as the other schools but that did not matter and never has to any MSU swimmer or diver. It is more than that; the culture, the challenge, the experience. Swimmers work their entire lives to pursue a dream like that. Countless hours in the pool, early mornings and a determination like no other. MSU swimmers are some of the toughest- both mentally and physically and I could see that from my first visit and wanted to be part of that.

                                        MSU swimming taught me so many things. I won't lie, I was extremely challenged and had some really hard days. It is TOUGH work, but I first and foremost learned that I had an entire team and great coaches supporting me day in and day out. I learned to appreciate challenges, pain and wins/loses- all things that made me stronger and feel accomplished. Not only did MSU swimming teach me life lessons about hard work, but I also met lifelong friends and my husband on that team- this program holds a special place in my heart because it gave me my life and I will forever be grateful.

It was a family that welcomed me warmly as a young freshman, then demanded of me more than anyone ever had, producing a capable and confident adult. I learned about myself, about working with a diverse group, about meeting multiple expectations. And I met a lifelong support group, one that helped me through college, and one that has continued to support each other through life.

As a skinny Belgian swimmer MSU and its coaches developed me into an 2x All-American and Olympian at the 1988 Games. Through that experience I have coached 2 Olympians, and have been to all the Olympic games since (Tokio should have been the 9th!!) as a colour commentator for the Belgian TV, always sitting behind Rowdy Gaines. Besides that, with the education MSU gave me I managed a successful family owned auctionhouse since 1992.

Not even mentioning the lasting friendships with former swimmers and coaches, the swimming program gave a lot.

I came in with a 1/4 scholarship and refused a full one my junior year so that the program could become a better one. I must have been the cheapest All-American on campus!

I do get up at night (6 hours difference) to watch Izzo’s team, but this will be with a complete different feeling if the swimming programs are abandoned.

Go Green Go white.

                                        I never thought I’d be given the chance to represent a Big Ten school through athletics. MSU showed me that this school believes in a balance with academics and athletics; both are and should be important to the student-athlete. Also, this school doesn’t let any great work go unrecognized; when I was told that they hosted an annual Academic Gala to recognize the amazing work the athletes put into the classroom, I knew that it was the place for me.

At a time when a lot of people didn’t necessarily think I could recover from a significant injuries as the result of an auto accident, the MSU coaches stuck with me. I went on to prove to myself and to them that they made the right decision after placing top 4 at the Ohio State Swimming championships. I now drive around Cincinnati, OH proudly displaying my “MICH ST” license plate because of my belief that green and white are truly the only colors.

                                        I grew up in a rural state with a small swimming community. I was used to winning, and I knew I wanted a challenge. When I was looking at schools the only collegiate program in my state was the U of North Dakota. I wanted to experience living far away and so I looked towards the B1G stage. I was fortunate to find Coach G and his Michigan State Spartans. I found more than a team to help me grow as an athlete, I found a family. I was intimidated by the competing at the highest level, but the team helped me find confidence in my abilities. This confidence translated into my leadership on the team, and eventually into my personal goals to achieve more outside of my athletic career.

While I was away at MSU, I watched my home state cut their only collegiate swim program in the state at the U of ND. I was heartbroken for my small state and the future of North Dakota’s swimmers. More than ever, I felt I had a larger duty to represent ND while I was at MSU.

Now, I’m back in my home state coaching for the community that I was a part of for 13 years. My heart has been broken once again as I witnessed my own Alma mater make the same irrational decision to discontinue their swim & dive team. My heart aches for the future of all swim communities- small and large. If we’re not safe in small states like ND or on the B1G stage, then where are we safe? Which team will be next? I want more for the future of college swimming.

                                        Michigan State swimming gave me a place to excel in and out of the pool. The coaches along with my teammates have always pushed me to do my very best and they motivate me everyday. I got the spartan head tattooed on my back because I wouldn't want to swim anywhere else. I am proud to swim for MSU and represent them at the Olympic Trials in June 2021.

                                        I actually was a UofM fan back in high school, and I started crying when Coach G called me and asked me to come visit because I didn't want to come! But I came and Ellie Roche showed me around campus and I met Coach Kathleen and some other members of the team and instantly fell in love. The campus was beautiful and after talking with the coaches I knew they could lead me to become the nationally ranked breaststroker that I am today. I wouldn't have chose any other school than MSU.

                                        Don't take anything for granted. Although we might not have the biggest pool or the fanciest weight room, that didn't matter to me. And now all of that is going to be taken away from my teammates and I. I am heartbroken knowing that I could very well be one of the last swimmers to graduate from MSU.

                                        I only swam with the team for a year and it has made a lasting impact. From this program, I have made life-long friends. From tough practices, to team events, to volunteering, the swim and dive team has a bond like no other. And not only did the coaches contribute to making you a better swimmer/diver, but a better human being. This team is truly a family. I also was able to watch both of my sisters swim for State. I watched them earn letterman jackets and I watched them finish their senior year at B1Gs with best times. I think it shows something special when you have a team with multiple sets of siblings, or a younger athlete following in an older siblings footsteps.

                                        This program represents: family, hard work and dedication not only to the sport of swimming but also to your teammates. Although I have always been incredibly swimming-focused, this team has given me a greater purpose and has made me want to perform well for the success of the team as a whole- not just myself. I think a lot of people do not understand the tight-knit community that is MSU Swim & Dive which extends far beyond our time in the pool and our 4 years in East Lansing.

I also wanted to be apart of a growing program and contribute to something larger than myself/ move up a spot each year at BigTen's.

                                        "Mudita" as Coach G says. This idea that your team is your family. Yes- you push each other, occasionally battle for a relay spot, and are there to work harder each and every day: but this idea that at the end of your four years you leave with a family as close as your own- is the biggest lesson I am learning and have learned thus far.

I simply felt at home when I stepped on campus. Coach G and Coach Kathleen are honest, generous, understanding, and truly some of the kindest people. They genuinely care about each and every athlete and I felt that immediately after meeting them. They emphasize the importance of school work, taught me to be a team player, and most importantly taught me the values of being a Spartan.

Balancing the rigor of Chemical Engineering with a mentally demanding sport such as diving was difficult to be sure, but with the encouragement of my teammates and the coaching staff I learned I was capable of far more than I ever imagined. The friendships I developed and mentorship of my coaches and teammates are invaluable resources that I continue to draw upon to this day.

I knew coach Best from summer camps, knew I would enjoy working with him, and he was willing to let me walk on to the team.

The phrase Spartans will really resonates with me. It speaks to the determination of our student athletes, and the Swim and Dive team embodies this phrase more than most. They have been achieving in spite of the obstacles and doing more with less for a long time. They perform well both in the classroom and in the pool. I would not be as successful as I am today without the opportunity to dive at MSU.

Seeing how quickly and fiercly a huge amount of alumni rallied around the current team to save the program speaks volumes about the impact that being a part of this team has had on all of our lives. Your teammates and coaches see your struggles and successes in and out of the pool and are there to support you every step of the way. Everyone understands the hard work, determination, and grit it takes to be a part of the program and we are strongly connected because of it. Though it's been years since I've competed, this program will always be family.

                                        Being part of the MSU program was so much more than a just swim team. It taught me how to mentally persevere, how to be a leader, & how to believe in myself. This program helped me grow into the woman I am today by demanding the best of me when I didn’t think it was possible. If it weren’t for swimming, I wouldn’t have attended MSU & gone on to meet some of my best friends, and the greatest mentors in my life. Those individuals were my family away from home. They even introduced me to the network within the packaging industry, which directly ties to where I work today. I am forever indebted to the program.

                                        I chose Michigan State University because even from the short time I was visiting during my recruiting trip, I could sense the dynamic of the team was unmatched. I could tell the coaches valued success outside of the pool as much as they valued success in the pool. There was a sense of support and endearment amongst the team I knew I wouldn't get anywhere else. I knew by coming here, I would be surrounded by like-minded people and an overwhelming amount of resources to thrive. If I were to go back in time and do it all over again, I would always choose MSU.

To get faster and grow in relationship with my teammates and coaches. MSU gave me the opportunity to be a division 1 collegiate athlete. You can’t just take that away from someone. It means everything to me. I feel like I speak for all my teammates when I say that without swimming at state a lot of us feel like we’ve lost our identity because swimming is all we’ve ever know and what we’ve dedicated our life’s work to.

I had a meet in the outdoor pool one and bought a michigan state swimming quarter zip, I still have it to this day. Resembling a dream come true, a childhood dream. I never expected to make it this far in my career but am so proud of myself for accomplishing my dreams. This program means the world to me and gave me everything I have today. I don’t know where I would be without it.

                                        <p className="sponsor__text">
                                        I chose MSU for the community and environment that the MSU Swimming and Diving program provided. I felt that this unique group of people, their values and their passions were not able to be replicated at any other program in the nation. This team, with its encompassing focus on athletics, academics, and the community around us, is the reason I chose Spartan Swimming and Diving.                                         </p>

                                        To cherish the experiences you get to have and to never take anything for granted; tomorrow, your whole world can collapse in the blink of an eye, changing your life forever, so live in the present, for the future is always uncertain.                                         </p>

                                        The program was my instant family away from home. It gave me some of the best experiences of my life with travel, relationships, Varsity Club community work and interaction with other sports teams. The team was a source of strength, community and humor and has remained a touchstone to MSU, all these years later.                                        </p>

                                        MSU was an hour from my hometown and my teenage coach contacted the MSU coach, who invited me to campus for a visit. While I was not provided a scholarship, I chose MSU to be part of such a great university.                                        </p>

                                        When I first arrived to Michigan State’s campus in East Lansing in 2006, I immediately felt a sense that I belonged there. I was a high school State Champion and I was heading to the #1 University for College of Education in the country. I majored in education to become a teacher to make a difference in the world because helping others was a passion of mine. However, another reason I chose Michigan State was that the swimming and diving team felt like the right fit for me.
At the time, I didn’t realize that being a student athlete at Michigan State would provide experiences that taught me skills to become successful. Swimming is a sport where you learn to manage your time when you have school each day and practices twice per day. Swimming and Diving also made my teammates and I prepare to achieve success. There were times where I failed in the classroom and in the pool. The mental toughness my coaches and teammates taught me gave me the strength to fight through these tough times and persevere to succeed. During a swim invitational, Coach Gianiodis gave me some advice that resonated with me. ”This it not a four month season, but a four year journey.” That journey prepared me for the real world after graduation.
Every student hears their whole life that the real world can be difficult and is a “shock” for anyone entering it after college. I still use the values Michigan State swimming and diving taught me. Showing up to work on time, managing your priorities, showing grit during tough times, becoming a leader to help out your organization, and working with a team towards a common goal are all things any employer would look for when searching for the right candidate.
The memories I have from Michigan State swimming and diving impacted my teammates. We are a united front that wants the right thing to happen and to give the opportunity for young student athletes to grow into successful adults. My teammates at Michigan State to this day remain my best friends. I care deeply about the opportunities that are being taken away from current athletes and coaches. I hope the leaders at Michigan State can look at this situation more seriously and realize that this much more than a swim and dive program. It gives student athletes a chance to grow and become something bigger than themselves.
Today, I am a middle school teacher and a high school swim coach at Birmingham Public Schools. I teach my student athletes the same lessons that my team at Michigan State taught me because I want them to be successful one day, too.
Please consider this; what athletes do at Michigan State goes beyond their time in college. It is a journey that give every student athlete an opportunity to grow and become a success.

                                            In my senior year (2013-2014), I was assigned to Swimming and Diving for the Athletic Training program. This was my first time being involved with the sport ever. Immediately, I fell in love with the sport and all it has to offer. It provided an incredible and educational experience for our Athletic Training program and for me personally. This sport provides evaluations, treatments, rehabs, communication, creativity, preventative methods, organization, and progressional responsibility in ways that you will not find with any other sport. These are true values to the athletic trainers' skill sets. Ending this program will have a domino effect and will hurt the clinical opportunities provided in the athletic training program. These student-athletes and coaches deserve to be able to compete and train for this university at the NCAA D1 level. They also deserve to be cared for and treated by your nationally recognized Athletic Training program. These men and women are the types of student-athletes you want to be representing Michigan State University, they carry themselves with high expectations academically, the utmost pride for their sport and school, and professionally when representing MSU in and out of the pool. What they have been able to accomplish with the facility and budget is incredible. They are very connected with the community and serve as role models for their previous High Schools/club teams, friends, families, strangers, and MSU students. Coach Matt Gianiodis, Eric Best, and Kathleen Milloy make this team such an honor to be a part of. They are welcoming, professional, and created a family atmosphere. I worked with almost every varsity sport at MSU and no other team comes close to offering an atmosphere like this. This is the type of sport, coaches, and student-athletes that this university can build on from having in the athletic department. This is not the prime time TV sport or the face of the university but this is the blue-collar, backbone, and foundation of MSU Athletics that this school does benefit from morally, ethically, and on a personal level. This sport and team had a positive impact on my life and career. I am forever grateful for my time and experience with the program!
